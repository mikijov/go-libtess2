# Documentation Requirements

- **Function Documentation**: Every function or variable that is touched must have documentation. If
  you modify a function that does not have documentation, add documentation to it.
- **Code Comments**: Add inline comments for complex logic only; do not comment obvious simple
  things.
- **README Updates**: Update README files when adding new features or changing architecture.
